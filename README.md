# Interactive Fairy Tale Emotion Analysis Visualization üìä ü¶Ñ

Welcome to my project that leverages the power of D3.js, Python, and machine learning to analyze and visualize the emotional tones in fairy tales. This project aims to understand how children's stories can shape one's perception through the lens of emotional tones in what they perceive from the story.

## Project Overview

This visualization explores the emotional tone (positive, negative, or neutral) of various fairy tales. By analyzing these stories, we seek to uncover their impact on children, focusing on the narratives' positive, negative, or neutral nature.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: A web experience that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.
- **Interactive Line and Bar Charts**: Visualize emotional tone progression over time and the percentage composition of each emotion in the stories.
- **Dynamic Story Selection**: Interact with a virtual book display that updates the charts based on the selected story.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web interface for interactive front-end development.
- **JavaScript (D3.js)**: For creating interactive data visualizations using a object oriented approach of the various graphs with enter, update, exit sequence.
- **Python (RoBERTa Model, PyTorch, and NLTK)**: Used in the backend to perform sentiment analysis using the RoBERTa model 

## Visualization Goals

- **Simplicity and Accuracy**: Present complex data in an easily digestible format while maintaining accuracy.
- **Aesthetics and Interaction**: Focus on a user-friendly design with intuitive controls and smooth transitions.
- **Narrative and Comparison**: Tell a compelling story about the emotional makeup of fairy tales and allow for comparison between stories.

## The Story Behind the Data

Using sentiment analysis powered by the RoBERTa model, this project delves into the emotional depth of fairy tales, examining whether they lean towards positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This exploration is crucial in understanding the moral and emotional fabric woven into these tales.

## Different Perspectives

- **Emotional Composition**: Analyze whether stories are portrayed more positively or negatively and how that impacts children.
- **Emotional Evolution**: Observe how emotional tones evolve throughout the story, highlighting key moments and their emotional significance.

## Supported Tasks

- **Adaptive Visualization**: Ensure seamless functionality across different devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Enable users to filter and interact with the data, particularly in the line chart, for a more engaged analysis.
- **Precise Data Representation**: Implement tooltips and clear axes for accurate data interpretation.
- **Dynamic Story Selection**: Change the data visualization dynamically based on the selected fairy tale.

## Design Considerations

1. **Pie Chart**: To represent the overall emotional composition of each story.
2. **Line Chart**: To depict the change in emotional tones over the course of the story.
3. **Interactive Book Display**: Central to the project, allowing for dynamic selection and visualization of stories.
